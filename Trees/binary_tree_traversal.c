//process of visiting each node in the tree exactly once in some order
/* Two tree traversal algorithms: breadth first and depth first
Breadth first = first visit all nodes at a particular level and then go to the next level(level order traversal)
depth first = first visit left subtree, and then go to right subtree;
<root><left><right> = preorder traversal; <left><root><right> = Inorder traversal; <left><right><root> = postorder traversal;
inorder traversal of a BST will give sorted list
